Pino

Python template preprocessor

Pino is a template preprocessor that is designed to integrate easily with C-like
languages(such as C, C++, C#, and Java)

Getting Started

The dollar sign($) is used to signal the preprocessor. There are two types of 
syntaxes, expressiones and blocks. A python expression is evaluated by calling:

    $("hello")

Blocks allow flow control, such as:

    $if i is 5
    {
        hello
    }

Here is an example that creates a class that has a 5 variables:

    class foo
    {
        $for i in range(5)
        {
            int x$(i);
        }
    };

This will output:

    class foo
    {
            int x0;
            int x1;
            int x2;
            int x3;
            int x4;
    };


How it works

Overview

Pino evaluates python expressions in your source code. Thus, when it finds /$()/, 
it will evaluate whats inside of the parenthesis, and output that to the file. 
For example, if you type /$("hello")/ it will output /hello/ without the quotes to
the file. If you want to output /"hello"/ with quotes you can type 
/$(quote("hello"))/.
Now to process the file just add ".pino" extension to your file. Pino will 
process the file, and output to the same file name with the extension removed.
So a file named "foo.cpp.pino" will be processed and outputted to "foo.cpp".

Flow control

Flow control can be done using "if" and "for" statements". Here is the syntax 
for an if statement:

    $if conditional { output }

If the conditional is true then whatever is in the curly braces will be 
outputted. If it is not true, then nothing will be outputted. The conditional is
a python expresssion. Right now, else clauses are not supported. 
Here is the syntax for the for statement:

    $for python-for { output }

Everytime the for loop is run, it will output whats in the curly braces. The for
loop is evaluated from a python for loop.
